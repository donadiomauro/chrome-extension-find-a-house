Chrome Extension "Quarantine"
=============================

This plugin optimises the search by eliminating some adv and removing completely useless ads like the paid ones, those marked as unsuitable..

It makes reference to the following sites (currently the most popular)

- gumtree.com
- intolondon.com
- spareroom.co.uk
- rightmove.co.uk

When active, the plugin writes "Info: All ads have been removed." on the top of the page to indicate he did his dirty job.

I've created and tested it on Chrome version 31.0.1650.57 m and it's my first Chrome Extension.

I wrote this plugin when I was looking for a house here in London and I hope can be useful for others in the same situation.

I made a virtue of necessity..
